|workload is spread over the whole team (so one team member is often Xtimes more productive than the others...| Despite the commit count difference, workload was spread evenly|
|but nevertheless, here is a track record that everyone is contributing a lot| Evidence in GH - [Commits](https://github.com/Kashika08/ShopSync/commits/main)|
|Number of commits	in GH| Evidence in GH - [Commits](https://github.com/Kashika08/ShopSync/commits/main)|
|Number of commits: by different people	in GH| Evidence in GH - [Pulse](https://github.com/Kashika08/ShopSync/pulse)|
|Issues reports: there are many| In GH - [Issues](https://github.com/Kashika08/ShopSync/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue)|
|Issues are being closed	evidence in GH| [Closed Issues](https://github.com/Kashika08/ShopSync/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)|
|DOI badge: exists	in GH| In GH - [Readme.md](https://github.com/Kashika08/ShopSync/blob/main/README.md)|
|Docs: doco generated, format not ugly | in GH| 
|Docs: what: point descriptions of each class/function (in isolation)| In Codebase |
|Docs: how: for common use cases X,Y,Z mini-tutorials showing worked examples on how to do X,Y,Z| |
|Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing | Yes, animations, videos, motivation etc.|
|Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code.	| Evidence in GH - [Readme.md](https://github.com/Kashika08/ShopSync/blob/main/README.md)|
|Use of version control tools	| |
|Use of style checkers|	config files in GH showing your config |
|Use of code formatters|	config files in GH showing your this formatter's config|
|Use of syntax checkers| config files in GH showing this checker's config|
|Use of code coverage| 	config files in GH|
|Other automated analysis tools| config files in GH|
|Test cases exist| [TestCases](https://github.com/Kashika08/ShopSync/tree/main/tests)|
|Test cases are routinely executed| Github actions implemented|
|The files CONTRIBUTING.md lists coding standards and lots of tips on how to extend the system without screwing things up  |Guidelines in contributing.md |
|Issues are discussed before they are closed | Discussed on Whatsapp |
|Chat channel: exists| 	Link or screenshots |
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people) | Same package, server and config files updated by everyone. |
|Test cases: a large proportion of the issues related to handling failing cases.|If a test case fails, open an issue and fix it|
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools: everyone can get to all tools and files| |
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people)	| |
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. tutor can ask anyone to share screen, they demonstrate the system running on their computer)| | 
|Evidence that the members of the team are working across multiple places in the code base	| [Contributors](https://github.com/Kashika08/ShopSync/graphs/contributors)
| Short release cycles| (hard to see in short projects) project members are committing often enough so that everyone can get your work|
