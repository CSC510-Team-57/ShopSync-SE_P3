## Multithreading 
**Phase 2** : In Phase 2, the project was running slow and was not able to show all websites at once <br>
**Phase 3** : In phase 3, we developed parallel processing/ multi-threading to run all websites parallely for a product.

## Website Created
**Phase 2** : In phase 2, there was no website for the project <br>
**Phase 3** : In phase 3, we developed a website using StreamLit. This websites takes the product as input and gives the website links. These links can be directly opened from the application. A UI interface is created, given any product as the input, the website gives the product list from different websites to compare the prices of the same product on different websites.
